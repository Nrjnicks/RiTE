RiTE has lap race, Timed race, one-on-one rivalry death match, and (the best one) weapon based car Survival Race.

Lap race, just like any other lap race you have to circulate the track 2 times and have to score rank first to win.
Timed Race is based on an error which machine make when loading fails, in this
level everywhere is confusion- loading the car texture failed, loading the rival car failed, buildings textures failed, AI system fails. You are placed in action, what you see is chaos, buildings are flying, placed in wrong directions, the rival car is behaving odd, player don't even knows where to go, what only he need to know is search a green light and reach it before the clock strikes 0:00.

Death match is something like the old medieval style jousting match. In this level both player will try to bring the other car on its hood for at least 10 seconds by smashing, clashing and doing whatever they could to win.

Surviving game level is based on weapons, all the cars will chose a weapon and will try to attack other cars and survive. Weapons include a Law80, a RPG, an Arrow Launcher, a heavy Spherical bomb, which are all attack type weapons. Including them there is another category of weapon which is special weapon or defensive weapons which include Nitro, shield, and spikes and First aid kit.
The aim for this level is to destroy all other cars without you been defeated. So choose a weapon and kill them all.

Enjoy the Game :)
